# Remote access

Sometimes I will want to be able to access my server from anywhere not only in my home network. To do this there are three main options. Port forwarding, VPN or a tunnel. Each one has their pros and cons.

## 1. Port Forwarding
Port forwarding is something that is managed by the router of the network. It takes the local IP and port and sends it to the internet where it is given a public IP that anyone can use to access. While it is good to give devices outside the network access to the network it can be quite hard to set up securely as anyone can have access.

## 2. VPN
A Virtual Private Network is another way to let devices on separate networks communicate securely by making a dedicated path between them through the internet making there own private network. They allow users to connect to each other without making them directly accessible to the internet. There are 3 main types of VPN. PPP, PPTP and IPsec but I will not be going into that with to much detail. Technically a VPN is a method of tunneling however here I am putting it under a different heading.

## 3. Tunnel


## I went with
For my needs I chose to go with A VPN. While there are a few different options I chose to go with Tailscale. This is because it is easy to set up as a beginner and I want to set it up quickly so that I am able to add to it when I am not on the network.
